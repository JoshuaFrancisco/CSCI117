% Answer program related questions with executable code (executable from within the Mozart UI) 

% Note: While many of these questions are based on questions from the book, there are some
% differences; namely, extensions and clarifications. 

% Part 1 (Invariants and Proofs)
% For this section, you will state the invariant, and write an inductive proof (base case and inductive case
% similar to the Fact example from class)

% (a)
local
  fun {IterLength I Ys}
    case Ys
    of nil then I
    [] _|Yr then {IterLength I+1 Yr} end
    end
  in
    fun {Length Xs}
      {IterLength 0 Xs}
    end 
  end
/*
Invariant: I + Length Ys
Base Case: I = 0 Ys = nil invariant = 0 + 0 = 0
Inductive Proof:
	Inductive case: Yr in the recursion call is Tail Ys so Yr can be replaced with Tail Ys. Length(Tail Ys) is Length(Ys)-1 b/c tail Ys is just Ys but with the first element m             issing. Invariant = (I + 1) + Length(Yr) = I + 1 + Length(Tail Ys) = I + (Length(Tail Ys) + 1) = I + Length Ys
*/
		     
% (b)
local
  fun {IterReverse Rs Ys}
    case Ys
    of nil then Rs
    [] Y|Yr then {IterReverse Y|Rs Yr} end
    end 
  in
    fun {Reverse Xs} 
      {IterReverse nil Xs}
    end 
  end

/*
Invariant: Reverse(Ys) ++ Rs (Must be in this order Ys first then add Rs) basically reversing the lists.
Base Case: Rs = (nil/0) Ys = (nil/0), Invariant = (nil/0) + (nil/0) = 0
Inductive Proof:
	Inductive case: The Addition property(a+b=b+a) allows for 2 things to be added to swap postions and produce same result.
	Y is the head of the list Ys while Yr is the tail of the list Ys so Y ++ Yr = Ys
        invariant = (Y ++ Rs) ++ Reverse(Yr) = Reverse(Yr) ++ (Y ++ Rs) = (Reverse(Yr) ++ Y) ++ Rs = Reverse(Ys) ++ Rs
*/

% (c) - write an iterative version of SumList, then find the invariant and create an inductive proof

%******* Non-iterative version of SumList ************

fun {SumList L} 
  case L
  of nil then 0
  [] X|L1 then X+{SumList L1} 
  end
end
%******* Non-iterative version of SumList ************

%******* Iterative version of Sumlist ************
declare L 
L = [1 2 3]

local
  fun {IterSumList I Ys}
    case Ys
    of nil then I
    [] Y|Yr then {IterSumList I+Y Yr} end
    end
  in
    fun {SumList Xs}
      {IterSumList 0 Xs}
    end 
end
{Browse {SumList L}}
%******* Iterative version of Sumlist ************

/*
Invariant: I + Sum(L)
Base Case: I = 0, L = nil
Inductive Proof:
	Inductive Case: I is the head of the list L and Ls is the tail of L.
        head L + tail L = L so I + Ls = L. (I + I) + Sum(Ls) = I + I + Sum(tail L) = I + (head I + Sum(Tail L)) = I + Sum L
*/

% (d)
fun {SumList L}
   case L
   of nil then 0
fun {Merge Xs Ys} 
  case Xs # Ys
  of nil # Ys then Ys
  [] Xs # nil then Xs
  [] (X|Xr) # (Y|Yr) then
     if X<Y then X|{Merge Xr Ys} 
     else Y|{Merge Xs Yr}
     end
  end
end

fun {MergeSort Xs}
  fun {MergeSortAcc L1 N}
    if N==0 then 
      nil # L1
    elseif N==1 then 
      [L1.1] # L1.2
    elseif N>1 then
      NL=N div 2
      NR=N-NL
      Ys # L2 = {MergeSortAcc L1 NL} 
      Zs # L3 = {MergeSortAcc L2 NR}
    in
      {Merge Ys Zs} # L3
    end 
  end
in
  {MergeSortAcc Xs {Length Xs}}.1
end

/*
Invariant: (Don't know)
Base Case: N = 0, L1 = nil
Inductive Proof:
       Inductive Case: When Xs is equal to 1 or 0, the  array is sorted. {MergeSort n}. {MergeSortAcc (n1)/2 (n2)/2}. Array a will be between p...m and (m+1)...q. a is now sorted betw       een p and q.

% Part 2

% 1. Section 3.4.2 defines the Append function by doing recursion on the first argument. 
%    What happens if we try to do recursion on the second argument? Here is a possible solution:

fun {Append Ls Ms} 
  case Ms
  of nil then Ls
  [] X|Mr then {Append {Append Ls [X]} Mr} 
  end
end

% Is this program correct? Does it terminate? Why or why not?

% This program is incorrect and it terminates. Located in the program there is a unification error with the first value (<P/3 Append>) and second value (<P/3>).

% 2. This exercise explores the expressive power of dataflow variables. 
%    In the declarative model, the following definition of append is iterative:

fun {Append Xs Ys} 
  case Xs
  of nil then Ys
  [] X|Xr then X|{Append Xr Ys} 
  end
end

% We can see this by looking at the expansion:

proc {Append Xs Ys ?Zs} 
  case Xs
  of nil then Zs=Ys 
  [] X|Xr then Zr in
    Zs=X|Zr
    {Append Xr Ys Zr}
  end 
end

% This can do a last call optimization because the unbound variable Zr can be put in the list 
% Zs and bound later. Now let us restrict the computation model to calculate with values only. 
% How can we write an iterative append? One approach is to define two functions: (1) an 
% iterative list reversal and (2) an iterative function that appends the reverse of a list to 
% another. Write an iterative append using this approach.

% Note - by values only, we mean that every identifier must be bound to a value upon declaration

declare X Y
X = [1 2 3]
Y = [4 5 6]

fun {IterReverse Ys Rs}
    case Ys
    of nil then Rs
    [] Y|Yr then {IterReverse Yr (Y|Rs)} end
end 

local
   proc {ReverseAppend Xs Ys ?Zs} 
      case Xs
      of nil then Zs=Ys
      [] X|Xr then Yss = X|Ys
      in
      {ReverseAppend Xr Yss Zs}
      end
   end

in
   fun{Append Xs Ys}
      {ReverseAppend {IterReverse Xs nil} Ys}
   end
end

{Browse {Append X Y}}

% 3. Calculate the number of operations needed by the two versions of the Flatten function given 
%    in Section 3.4.4. With n elements and maximal nesting depth k, what is the worst-case complexity 
%    of each version? 
%    Note - Assume IsList uses constant time to check if an input is a list and the append in the 
%           first function works in O(n) time

%  First, run the functions on the example [[1 2 3] [1 2] [1 2 [2 3 4]] 3 4] and give the exact number
%  of operations for execution.

declare X
X = [[1 2 3] [1 2] [1 2 [2 3 4]] 3 4]

fun {Flatten Xs} 
  case Xs
  of nil then nil
  [] X|Xr andthen {IsList X} then
    {Append {Flatten X} {Flatten Xr}} 
  [] X|Xr then
    X|{Flatten Xr}
  end 
end

fun {Flatten Xs}
  proc {FlattenD Xs ?Ds}
    case Xs
    of nil then Y in Ds=Y#Y
    [] X|Xr andthen {IsList X} then Y1 Y2 Y4 in
      Ds=Y1#Y4 
      {FlattenD X Y1#Y2}
      {FlattenD Xr Y2#Y4}
    [] X|Xr then Y1 Y2 in
      Ds=(X|Y1)#Y2 {FlattenD Xr Y1#y2}
    end 
  end Ys
  in {FlattenD Xs Ys#nil} Ys
end

declare X
X = [[1 2 3] [1 2] [1 2 [2 3 4]] 3 4]
end
{Browse {Flatten X}}

% Time complexity of Flatten is O(n) (worst case)

% 4. The following is a possible algorithm for sorting lists. Its inventor, C.A.R. Hoare, called it 
%    quicksort, because it was the fastest known general-purpose sorting algorithm at the time it 
%    was invented. It uses a divide and conquer strategy to give an average time complexity of O(n log n).
%    Here is an informal description of the algorithm for the declarative model. Given an input list L. 
%    Then do the following operations:
%      (a) Pick Lâ€™s first element, X, to use as a pivot.
%      (b) Partition L into two lists, L1 and L2, such that all elements in L1 are less than X and 
%          all elements in L2 are greater or equal than X.
%      (c) Use quicksort to sort L1 giving S1 and to sort L2 giving S2.
%      (d) Append the lists S1 and S2 to get the answer.
%    Write this program with difference lists to avoid the linear cost of append.

declare L
L = [5 4 2 7 4]

fun {AppendQuick Xs Ys}
   case Xs of X|Xr then
      X|{AppendQuick Xr Ys}
   [] nil then Ys
   end
end

declare
proc {Partition L2 X L R}
   case L2
   of Y|M2 then
      if Y<X then Ln in
     L=Y|Ln
     {Partition M2 X Ln R}
      else Rn in
     R=Y|Rn
     {Partition M2 X L Rn}
      end
   [] nil then L=nil R=nil
   end
end

declare
fun {Quicksort L}
   case L of  X|L2 then Left Right SL SR in
      {Partition L2 X Left Right}
      SL={Quicksort Left}
      SR={Quicksort Right}
      {AppendQuick SL X|SR}
   [] nil then nil end
end
